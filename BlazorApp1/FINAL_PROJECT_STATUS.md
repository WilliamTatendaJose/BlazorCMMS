## ? PAGES COMPLETED

### Today's Session
1. **Dashboard.razor** - FIXED ?
   - Resolved bracket mismatch
   - Completed GenerateRecentActivities()
   - Added ActivityItem class
   - Build: PASSING

2. **FailureModes.razor** - CONVERTED ?
   - Applied async/await pattern
   - Created LoadDataAsync()
   - Converted SaveFailureMode() ? SaveFailureModeAsync()
   - Build: PASSING

### Previously Completed
3. **Assets.razor** - FULLY ASYNC ?
   - Async CRUD operations
   - Document upload support
   - Complete error handling

4. **WorkOrders.razor** - FULLY ASYNC ?
   - Async work order management
   - Responsive filtering
   - Status updates

---

## ??? TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Async Pattern Applied
```
? OnInitializedAsync() - Lifecycle
? LoadDataAsync() - Data loading
? SaveAsync() - Create operations
? UpdateAsync() - Update operations
? DeleteAsync() - Delete operations
? Event handlers with async/await
```

### Build Quality
```
Errors:              0 ?
Warnings:            0 ?
Compilation Time:    <2 seconds
Last Build Status:   SUCCESSFUL
```
